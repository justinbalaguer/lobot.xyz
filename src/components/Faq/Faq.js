          <b>Goal of this NFT?</b>
          <p>- The goal is simple. To mint an affordable NFT that you can own and collect or 
            show it off as your avatar or profile picture on social media. Minting doesn't have to be expensive.</p>
          <b>Roadmap?</b>
          <p>- There is no roadmap. Limited to only 100 lobot and it will be sold-out forever.</p>
          <b>Minted. Where is it?</b>
          <p>- In your phantom wallet, it's under the collectibles tab.</p>
